# üöÄ Enhanced LeetCode Chatbot

An intelligent chatbot that can answer complex queries requiring data from multiple collections with smart data access patterns.

## ‚ú® Enhanced Features

### üîó Multi-Collection Queries
The chatbot can fetch data from multiple collections in a single query and automatically detects when multiple collections are needed:
- **Batches Collection**: Only accessed when needed for batch/section queries
- **Contest Questions Collection**: Only accessed for contest details (not student performance)
- **Students Collection**: Contains all student details with performance in latest 5 contests
- **Automatic Detection**: The agent determines when a query requires multiple collections
- **All-Batches Default**: When no specific batch is mentioned, automatically provides data across ALL batches

### üß† Smart Data Access Patterns
- **Batches**: Only fetched when asked about number of batches, batch names, or number of sections
- **Contests**: Only fetched when asked about contest details (names, questions, etc.)
- **Students**: Contains all student information including performance in latest 5 contests only

### üìä Enhanced Query Capabilities

#### 1. Total Sections Across All Batches
```
"How many sections are there in total across all batches?"
```
- Fetches from batches collection
- Sums up section counts from all batches
- Provides breakdown by batch

#### 2. Contest Information
```
"What contests are available?"
"What questions were asked in the contests?"
```
- Fetches contest details only (same across all batches)
- Does not access student performance data
- Provides contest names, questions, and general information
- No batch specification needed since contest details are identical across all batches

#### 3. Student Performance (Limited to Latest 5 Contests)
```
"What is the performance of student john-doe in batch24-25?"
```
- Shows student details and latest 5 contests only
- Clearly informs about the 5-contest limitation
- Provides comprehensive student information

#### 4. Top Students (Both Rankings)
```
"Show me top 50 students in batch24-25"
"Who are the top 10 students?"  # Automatically across all batches
```
- Always provides both rating and problems solved rankings
- Can work for specific batches or across all batches
- Automatically defaults to all batches when no specific batch mentioned
- Shows batch information for each student when querying across all batches
